# geospatialAnalysis
After reading some Geospatial Analysis tech articles, I discovered how interactive maps can be built in Python thanks to two amazing libraries: *Geopandas* and *Folium*.<br>
Being a "geography geek" the topic has immediatly caught my interest, so I've started creating my own geospatial visualizations which I collect in this repository<br>

## 1. Topologic-Morphing World: how borders evolved through ages
**GITHUB PAGE:** [topoMorphingWorld](https://hize00.github.io/geospatialAnalysis/topoMorphingWorld.html)<br>
In this visualization we can see how countries borders evolved over time among different ages. Data related to borders were collected from [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20080328104539/http://library.thinkquest.org:80/C006628/download.html). As the [disclaimer page](http://web.archive.org/web/20080328161758/http://library.thinkquest.org:80/C006628/disclaimer.html) warns, some of them are incorrect but anyaway I would like to send a big "thank you" to all the students involved in that project.<br>
The cool idea behind this visualization is that we can understand better and easier how borders changed through time and this could be appealing in different areas of study such as history, geography and geo-politics overall.
