# geospatialAnalysis
After reading some Geospatial Analysis tech articles, I discovered how interactive maps can be built in Python thanks to two amazing libraries: *Geopandas* and *Folium*.<br>
Being a "geography geek" the topic has immediatly caught my interest, so I've started creating my own geospatial visualizations which I collect in this repository<br>

## 1. Topologic-Morphing World: how borders evolved through ages
**GITHUB PAGE:** [topoMorphingWorld](https://hize00.github.io/geospatialAnalysis/topoMorphingWorld.html)<br>
In this visualization we can see how countries borders evolved over time among different ages. Data related to borders were collected from [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20080328104539/http://library.thinkquest.org:80/C006628/download.html) and converted into geojson files with [this tool](https://ogre.adc4gis.com/). As the [disclaimer page](http://web.archive.org/web/20080328161758/http://library.thinkquest.org:80/C006628/disclaimer.html) warns, some of the data are incorrect but anyway I would like to send a big "thank you" to all the students involved in that project.<br>
The cool idea behind this visualization is that we can understand better and easier how borders changed through time and this could be appealing in different areas of study such as history, geography and geo-politics overall.

## 2. Sic Mundus Est: digital atlas augmented with UN macroeconomic information
**DIGITAL ATLAS GITHUB PAGE:** [digitalAtlas](https://hize00.github.io/geospatialAnalysis/digitalAtlas.html)<br>
I love geography, since I was little I was fascinated by the shapes of countries and the history behind them and their borders. I know by heart the majority of capitals and flags (but I can't remember what I ate last night...) so the creation of a digital Atlas is lots of fun for me (Python + Geography: perfect match!)<br>
In order to create a digital Atlas I've downloaded a list of countries capitals with their latitude and longitude and
